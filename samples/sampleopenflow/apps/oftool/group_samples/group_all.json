/*****************************************************************************
    
    Example of a JSON encoded OpenFlow group table entry
    
    NOTE1: For each JSON encoded group entry the 'group-id' and 'group-type'
           are the must fields
    NOTE2: All numerical data should be encoded in decimal
    NOTE3: This JSON document can be annotated with comments that will be
           stripped off by the 'oftool' preprocessor when this file is used
           for configuring groups on a target device.
           o Multi-line comments:
            - start with '/*' and end with '*/'
            - can be split over multiple lines
            - any symbols written between '/*' and '*/' are ignored
            - comments cannot be nested
           o Single line comments:
            - start with '//' and span to the end of the line
            - can show up on lines by themselves or to the right of JSON
              statement on a line
            - the text after '//' is ignored
            - cannot be used inside JSON statements
