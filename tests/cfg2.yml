#    This configuration file contains information used by the test scripts.
#    That includes information about a Controller to be communicated to
#    and a NETCONF device being managed by the Controller.
#
#    Following configuration parameters are required:
#
#    ctrlIpAddr    - IP address of the Controller
#    ctrlPortNum   - TCP/UDP destination port number on the Controller
#    ctrlUname     - administrator user name on the Controller
#    ctrlPswd      - administrator user password on the Controller
#
#    nodeName      - NETCONF device identifier to be set on the Controller
#    nodeIpAddr    - IP address of the NETCONF device to be used by
#                    the Controller for establishing management session.
#    nodePortNum   - TCP/UDP destination port number configured on the
#                    NETCONF device for communication over NETCONF protocol
#    nodeUname     - administrator user name on the NETCONF device
#    nodePswd      - administrator user password on the NETCONF device
#
#    rundelay      - time interval (delay in seconds) between steps execution
#                    in demo scripts
#
#    Example of configuration:
#
#    ctrlIpAddr: 192.0.2.168
#    ctrlPortNum: 8181
#    ctrlUname: "name"
#    ctrlPswd: "password"
#
#    nodeName: "deviceName"
#    nodeIpAddr: 203.0.113.11
#    nodePortNum: 830
#    nodeUname: "name"
#    nodePswd: "password"
