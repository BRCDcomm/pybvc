When you are ready to release a new version of pybvc then follow these steps.

COPY FROM DEVELOPMENT REPOSITORY:
---------------------------------
1.  Update the development repository (git pull in elbrys/pydevodl)
2.  Update the release repository (git pull in brcd/pybvc)
3.  Remove contents of the pybvc folder in release repository (everything but __init__.py)
4.  Copy the framework folder contents from development to release:
        cp -r elbrys/pydevodl/framework/* brcd/pybvc
              NOTE the paths will need to be changed to match your setup
5.  In the brcd/pybvc folder do a global search and replace:  find 'pybvc.' and replace with 'pybvc.'
