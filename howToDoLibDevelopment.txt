This document is for contributors who will be modifying the pybvc library (rather than samples).
This document walks you through setting up your environment so that you can modify
the python files in pybvc and then run the samples without having to deploy a new version
of pybvc to pypi and then installing it again.  Instead your environment will use your
local pybvc (rather than installed library) so that your changes are used immediately.

1. cd to pybvc
2. python setup.py develop

If you want to 'undo' this you can:
1. cd to pybvc
2. python setup.py develop --uninstall

To check current pybvc being used:
1. pip list | grep pybvc
